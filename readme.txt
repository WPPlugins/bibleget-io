Creates a shortcode [bibleget] that you can use to insert Bible quotes in articles or pages; uses the BibleGet I/O Service endpoint https://query.bibleget.io

== Description ==

Creates a shortcode [bibleget] that you can use to insert Bible quotes in articles or pages from different versions of the Bible in different languages.
The text of the Bible quotes are retrieved from the BibleGet service endpoint *[https://query.bibleget.io](https://query.bibleget.io "BibleGet Service endpoint")*.
**USAGE:** [bibleget query="Exodus 19:5-6,8;20:1-17" version="CEI2008"] 
**USAGE:** [bibleget query="Matthew 1:1-10,12-15" versions="NVBSE,NABRE"] 

The Plugin also has a settings page “BibleGet I/O” under the “Settings” area in the Dashboard, 
where you can choose your preferred Bible versions from those available on the BibleGet server
so that you don’t have to use the “version” or “versions” option every time. 
After you have made your choices in the settings area, remember to click on “Save”!
Once the preferred version is set you can simply use:
**USAGE:** [bibleget query=“1 Cor 13”] 

The style settings are customizable using the Wordpress Customizer, 
so that the injected Bible quotes may fit into the style of your own blog / WordPress website.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I formulate a Bible citation? =
[ENGLISH]
The query parameter must contain a citation that is formulated following the standard notation for Bible citations (see [Bible citation notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_citation "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_citation")):
   * “:”: is the chapter – verse separator. “15:5” means “chapter 15, verse 5”.

   * “-”: is the from – to separator, and it can be used in one of three ways:

      1. from chapter to chapter: “15-16″ means “from chapter 15 to chapter 16”.
      2. from chapter,verse to verse (of the same chapter): “15:1-5” means “chapter 15, from verse 1 to verse 5”.
      3. from chapter,verse to chapter,verse “15:1-16:5” means “from chapter 15,verse 1 to chapter 16,verse 5”.

   * “,”: is the separator between one verse and another. “15:5,7,9” means “chapter 15,verse 5 then verse 7 then verse 9”.

   * “;”: is the separator between one query and another. “15:5-7;16:3-9,11-13” means “chapter 15, verses 5 to 7; then chapter 16, verses 3 to 9 and verses 11 to 13”.

At least the first query (of a series of queries chained by a semi-colon) must indicate the name of the book upon which to make the request;
 the name of the book can be written in full in more than 20 different languages, or written using the abbreviated form.
 See the page [Lista di Abbreviazioni di Libri](http://www.bibleget.io/come-funziona/lista-abbreviazioni-libri/ "Lista di Abbreviazioni di Libri").
 When a query following a semi-colon does not indicate the book name, it is intended that the request be made upon the same book as the previous query.
 So “Gen1:7-9;4:4-5;Ex3:19” means “Genesis chapter 1, verses 7 to 9; then again Genesis chapter 4, verses 4 to 5; then Exodus chapter 3, verse 19”.
